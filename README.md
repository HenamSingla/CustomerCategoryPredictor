# Customer Category Predictor
Unlock actionable customer insights with our ML-powered repository for cutting-edge customer classification and predictive analytics.

Overview:

Data science project for predicting customer categories using machine learning.

Implements both Logistic Regression and SVM classifiers.

Features:

Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values by creating dedicated dummy variables.

Converts categorical variables into multiple dummy features.

Modeling:

Baseline model using Logistic Regression.

SVM with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.

Evaluation:

Generates confusion matrices and computes accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores.

Plots ROC curves and calculates AUC scores.

Dependencies:

Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

Usage:

Ensure train.csv is in the repository directory.

Run the Python script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

Review outputs in the terminal and open ROCcurves.pdf for ROC curve analysis.
